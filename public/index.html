                    <p>The Flappy Ball Game is a simple and addictive arcade-style game inspired by the popular Flappy Bird. Instead of controlling a bird, you control a ball as it navigates through a series of obstacles. The objective is to keep the ball afloat by making it bounce and avoid hitting the pipes or obstacles in its path. The game features a challenging and fast-paced gameplay, with the goal of achieving the highest score possible by successfully maneuvering the ball through the narrow gaps.</p>
